# etraining
 An Eiffel Training Project
 
## Description
This project is designed to provide Eiffel Training documentation through itself—code in a project.

In this project you will find both classes and tests. The classes are an attempt at being Self-documenting (i.e. self-evident). The tests are designed to demonstrate the concepts in the classes through executable code. Stated another way—we hope the test "proves-the-point" of the class demonstrably.
