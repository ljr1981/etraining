# etraining
 An Eiffel Training Project
 
## Description
This project is designed to provide Eiffel Training documentation through itself—code in a project.

In this project you will find both classes and tests. The classes are an attempt at being Self-documenting (i.e. self-evident). The tests are designed to demonstrate the concepts in the classes through executable code. Stated another way—we hope the test "proves-the-point" of the class demonstrably.

## Concept Demostrations
Various concepts found in both OOSC-2 and in the ECMA-367 standard are demonstrated through classes and related tests (demos).

## Vision2 GUI Demonstrations
GUI related classes in the Vision2 library are demonstrated through AutoTest tests. You have two ways to experience the demo tests.
1. You can simply find the test for the GUI Class you are interested in and read it.
2. You can find the "show_me := False" and change the False to True, and then Re-compile and Run the test.

Be sure to change True back to False when you're done! Otherwise, running GUI Vision2 tests (demos) might give you lots of windows, errors, or both.

### WARNING
If you encounter Segfault errors in GUI Vision2 demo (tests), then you will want to CLOSE EiffelStudio and re-open the eTraining.test target project with a Clean Compile. You may also achieve this from the ES main menu: Project --> Compile from scratch (does the close-and-clean-compile in one click).
